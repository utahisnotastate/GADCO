                <li>All of our doors are treated with a state of the art carbonization process tailored specifically for your door that protects your product from warping, temperature fluctuations, humid climates, and microbes. Despite all precautions, long-term
                    exposure to direct sunlight and/or precipitation can damage the doors so we strongly recommend installing exterior doors in areas with an overhang at least half the distance the door is tall.

                <li>All of our pre-hung doors come with hinges. Besides hinges we can help you source and select any kind of hardware you need for your project. The hardware will be used to prep your door to your specifications, so they can be easily installed
                    on site when your door arrives.
